# Assignment 5 — Bash Script Automation Drill (OPS Checklist)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will practice Bash scripting by building a series of small automation scripts covering environment setup, variables, arrays, loops, file conditionals, if-else logic, and functions. These scripts form the foundation of real-world Linux automation used in DevOps, cloud, and production support environments.

# Task 1 — Bash Environment & Workspace Setup

## Goal

Verify that Bash is available on your system and create a clean workspace for this assignment.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of `echo $SHELL` and `bash --version`

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `pwd` and `ls -lah` showing the scripts directory

### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. What is Bash?**

Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a command‑line interpreter used on Linux and Unix systems. It allows you to run commands, automate tasks, and write scripts that control the system. It’s one of the most common shells used for scripting and server administration.

---

**2. What is the difference between shell and Bash?**

A shell is the general term for any command‑line interface that lets you interact with the operating system.Bash is one specific type of shell.

So:
- Shell = category (many types exist: sh, Bash, Zsh, Fish, etc.)
- Bash = one implementation of a shell, widely used for scripting and automation

---

**3. Why is it important to confirm the Bash version before writing scripts?**

Different Bash versions support different features and syntax.If a script uses features from a newer version, it may break on systems running an older version.
Confirming the Bash version ensures the script runs correctly, avoids compatibility issues, and prevents unexpected errors in production.

---

# Task 2 — Your First Bash Script

## Goal

Create your first Bash script, make it executable, and run it from the terminal.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Content of `first-script.sh`

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `./first-script.sh`

![Week 03 Screenshot](screenshots/week-03-screenshot-55.png)

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Output of `ls -l first-script.sh` showing executable permission

---

### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. What is the purpose of `#!/bin/bash`?**

**#!/bin/bash** is called a shebang. Its purpose is to tell the system which interpreter should run the script.When the script starts, the shebang ensures it is executed using Bash instead of another shell.
---

**2. Why do we use `chmod +x` before running a script?**

**chmod +x** makes the script executable. Without this permission, the system won’t allow you to run the file directly.Adding execute permission lets it run like a program.
---

**3. What is the difference between running a script using `./script.sh` and `bash script.sh`?**

**./script.sh**

 -Runs the script as an executable file

 - Uses the interpreter defined in the shebang (#!/bin/bash)

 - Requires chmod +x


**bash script.sh**

 - Runs the script through the Bash interpreter directly

 - Ignores the shebang

 - Does not require execute permission

---

# Task 3 — Variables: User Information Script

## Goal

Use variables to store and display user-related information.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Content of `user-info.sh`

![Week 03 Screenshot](screenshots/week-03-screenshot-57.png)

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `./user-info.sh`

![Week 03 Screenshot](screenshots/week-03-screenshot-58.png)

---

### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. What is a variable in Bash?**

Add your answer here.
A variable in Bash is a placeholder used to store a value such as text, numbers, or command output. Data saved in a variable can be reused later in the script.

**2. Why should we avoid spaces around the `=` sign when creating variables?**

Bash does not allow spaces around the **=** sign.
When spaces are added, Bash will treat the variable name or value as separate commands, which causes an error.

---

**3. How do you access the value stored inside a Bash variable?**

A variable is accessed by adding a $ before its name.This prints the value stored inside the variable.

---

# Task 4 — Arrays & Loops: Tools Checklist Script

## Goal

Use arrays and loops to print a checklist of tools used in Bash scripting.
